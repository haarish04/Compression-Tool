A simple txt file to keep track of my progress and how I designed this application

For this project I have chosen java as my language built with gradle. Building java projects with vscode is not straightforward. I referred to this page (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial) to setup java on vscode

For build tools I decided to choose gradle as it is go-to for all the projects in recent times. The other option was maven which I did not opt for. You can think of Gradle as goodness of Ant and Maven put together minus the noise of XML. And scriptability with groovy is very big plus.
Gradle build files are less verbose as they are written in groovy.
It provides very nice DSL for writing build tasks.
