# Compression Tool

This application is my solution to the Coding Challenges series by John Crickett. The page to this challenge can be found [here](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-huffman/).

## Description

The challenge is to build your own command like tool to compress text files.

In the early 1950s David Huffman developed an algorithm to find the optimal prefix code that can be used for lossless data compression.
Given there is usually an unequal distribution of character occurrences in text this can then be used to compress data by giving the most commonly occurring characters the shortest prefix.

To get a gist of the algorithm + the implementation part of Huffman encoding checkout [this page](https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/CS3/html/Huffman.html)
